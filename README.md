# Notes-App

This is a simple iOS app built with Swift and UIKit that uses a custom `UICollectionView` layout inspired by Pinterest. It leverages the [`PinterestLayout`](https://github.com/MagicLab-team/collection-view-layouts) open-source library to create a dynamic, staggered grid layout similar to what you see on Pinterest.

## Features

- Pinterest-style dynamic layout for collection views
- Lightweight and customizable UI
- CocoaPods integration
- Add or remove notes, edit them, lock them for private access
